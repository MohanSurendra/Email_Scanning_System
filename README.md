# Email Scanning System

This is a basic Email Scanning System developed as part of my summer internship during my college time in 2024.
The system is a Java-based web application designed to scan, monitor, and manage email activities for security purposes.
It provides administrators with tools to detect suspicious messages, maintain logs, and generate reports.
